# Placeholder Image

This file should be replaced with an actual image file named `placeholder-image.jpg` in the public folder.

To create a simple placeholder image, you can:

1. Download a placeholder image from a service like:
   - https://placehold.co/500x500/f0f0f0/888888?text=Image+not+available
   - https://via.placeholder.com/500x500?text=Image+not+available

2. Save it as `placeholder-image.jpg` in this public folder

3. Or create your own placeholder image using an image editor

The placeholder image will be used when mockup images fail to load in the FabricEditor component.
